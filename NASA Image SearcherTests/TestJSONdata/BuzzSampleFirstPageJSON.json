            "description": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- At NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, NASA officials and Apollo astronauts visiting Launch Pad 39B with their families and friends preserve the moment with a group portrait. The group was at Kennedy for a ceremony renaming the Operations and Checkout Building for Apollo 11 astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first person to set foot on the moon. From left are NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, Neil's granddaughter Lily Armstrong, Neil's grandson Bryce Armstrong, Neil's son Mark Armstrong, Neil's former wife Janet Armstrong, Neil's son Rick Armstrong, Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin, Buzz's friend Judy Rice, Apollo astronaut Jim Lovell, Mike Collins' daughter Ann Starr, Apollo 11 command module pilot Mike Collins, Buzz's grandson Jeffrey Schuss, Jeffrey's wife April Schuss, Buzz's son-in-law Bruce Hanifan, Buzz's daughter Jan Aldrin, Buzz's son Andy Aldrin, and Center Director Bob Cabana. The pad is being modified to support the agency's new Orion spacecraft which will lift off atop the Space Launch System rocket. Orion is designed to take humans farther than theyâ€™ve ever gone before, serving as the exploration vehicle that will carry astronauts to deep space and sustain the crew during travel to destinations such as an asteroid or Mars.      The visit of the former astronauts was part of NASA's 45th anniversary celebration of the Apollo 11 moon landing. As the world watched, Neil Armstrong and Neil Aldrin landed in the moon's Sea of Tranquility aboard the lunar module Eagle on July 20, 1969. Meanwhile, crewmate Michael Collins orbited above in the command module Columbia. For more, visit http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/july/nasa-honors-historic-first-moon-landing-eyes-first-mars-mission.

From left are NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, Apollo astronaut Jim Lovell, Buzz Aldrin's grandson Jeffrey Schuss, Jeffrey's wife April Schuss, Neil's former wife Janet Armstrong, Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin, Buzz's son-in-law Bruce Hanifan, Buzz's daughter Jan Aldrin, Buzz's son Andy Aldrin, Apollo 11 command module pilot Mike Collins, and Center Director Bob Cabana.
